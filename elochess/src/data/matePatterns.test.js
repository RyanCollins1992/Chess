// Regression test for real bugs found 2026-07-15: Boden's Mate's `fen` had
// a malformed castling field ("w d - 0 1" instead of "w - - 0 1"), which
// chess.js rejects — and useChessBoard's `new Chess(initialFen)` isn't
// wrapped in try/catch, so it threw synchronously during render and crashed
// the whole page the moment the pattern was selected. Auditing the rest of
// PATTERNS the same way turned up three more broken solutions (Smothered,
// Anastasia's, Arabian) that either weren't legal moves at all or didn't
// actually deliver checkmate — all fixed alongside Boden's. This test
// validates every pattern's FEN parses, and (for patterns with a solution)
// that the listed move is legal and actually delivers checkmate — the exact
// class of bug this page has no other coverage against.
