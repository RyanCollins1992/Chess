/**
 * "KnightPath" — MentorChess's visual identity. Layout/structure (two-tone
 * sidebar, radius, fonts) sourced from a Figma Make design Ryan shared
 * (2026-07-15, `Ryan's Brain/Chess Info/Chess ui code/`). Colors were
 * re-derived 2026-07-17 from the actual MentorChess logo Ryan designed
 * (`Ryan's Brain/Chess Info/Chess related images/MentorChess Logo.jpg`) —
 * sampled with Pillow rather than eyeballed: background `#121315`, king
 * `#F8F4E9`, pawn/ring gold `#D6B37B`. Both light and dark themes below are
 * built from that same three-color family (near-black / warm cream / gold)
 * with the standard 60/30/10 UI split (60% base canvas, 30% card/surface,
 * 10% accent reserved for interactive elements) — not independently themed,
 * so switching modes changes lightness, not identity.
 *
 * Light mode's gold (`#8C6A28`) is deliberately deeper than the logo's own
 * rendered gold (`#D6B37B`, used as-is in dark mode) — verified via WCAG
 * contrast math (`_contrast_check.py`, run ad hoc, not kept in the repo):
 * the raw logo gold only hits 1.8:1 as text on cream and 2.0:1 as a white-
 * text button background, both well under the 4.5:1 AA minimum. `#8C6A28`
 * clears both (4.54:1 and 4.99:1) while staying visibly the same gold
 * family, not drifting into brown.
 *
 * One structural wrinkle: the sidebar is a fixed dark panel in *both* modes
 * (KnightPath's original two-tone layout — the content area is what
 * switches with the mode, the sidebar doesn't). It's now set to the logo's
 * own near-black (`#121315`) instead of the old navy `#1C2130`, so the
 * sidebar logo mark (public/mentorchess-icon.png, which has that same
 * near-black background baked into the image) sits on its native color
 * instead of a mismatched navy square. The shared `bg2` token can't cover
 * the sidebar too (it's "card background," which needs to stay light in
 * light mode to match content-area cards), so the sidebar keeps its own
 * `sidebarBg`/`sidebarBorder`/`sidebarText`/`sidebarMuted` fields that
 * Sidebar.jsx/Topbar.jsx read directly instead of through bg2/white/muted.
